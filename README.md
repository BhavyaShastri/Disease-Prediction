# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
The Multiple Disease Predictor is a Machine Learning-based web application developed in Python. This project focuses on building a Multiple Disease Prediction System, capable of predicting diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.

## Technical Details
The application utilizes the following technical components:

- Python: The programming language used to implement the entire system.
- Machine Learning Models: Trained machine learning models are employed for disease prediction.
- Libraries: The project relies on various Python libraries, including:
- pickle for loading the saved machine learning models.
- streamlit for creating the web application.
- streamlit_option_menu for the sidebar navigation menu.
- Data Persistence: The machine learning models are stored using the pickle module.

## Features
- Disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease based on user-provided input data.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to input data.
- Fast and Accurate Predictions: Employs machine learning models to deliver rapid and precise predictions.
- Multiple Disease Selection: Allows users to choose which disease they want to predict from a sidebar navigation menu.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python libraries using pip.
- Run the Streamlit web app using streamlit run app.py.
- Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.
